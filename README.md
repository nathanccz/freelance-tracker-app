## ðŸ“œ About My Project

For the Mini Hackathon for Jobuary 2025, I created an freelancing tracker app for the 100Devs community. It will let you track leads, active clients, and your income over time. Plus, it serves as a resource hub for beginners and seasoned freelancers alike.

It's build on React and Vite, plus Appwrite for back-end functionality.
