## ðŸ“œ About My Project

For the Mini Hackathon for Jobuary 2025, I created a freelancing tracker app for the 100Devs community. It will let you track leads, active clients, and your income over time. It will also let you track your progress on individual project. Plus, it serves as a resource hub for beginners and seasoned freelancers alike.

It's built on React and Vite, plus Appwrite for back-end functionality.
